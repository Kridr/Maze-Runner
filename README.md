Probably my last project on HyperSkill

There are two main folders: "Problems" folder is problems I solved during the project development, %Project_name%/task/src is folder with source code on java

NOTE: This project has not been finished on Hyperskill because my free trial had been expired. 
However, I finished it by myself and sligthly changed some parts of the original problem

P.S.: I still don't know if I used the most optimal representation of a graph. I stored it as a set of edges. To find a path in the graph I used Wave Algo (Lee Algo).
